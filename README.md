# 🔩 Improved Robotic Joint Bracket Design

This project presents a mechanical improvement of a **robotic joint bracket** using **Onshape CAD software**. The design focuses on enhancing structural **strength and stability**, while maintaining the original dimensions and functionality of the initial design.

## 📐 Key Features

- **Base Dimensions**: 45 mm × 45 mm  
- **Bracket Thickness**: 5 mm  
- **Bolt Hole Diameter**: 5 mm  
- **Center Circular Plate**: 55 mm diameter, 10 mm thick  
- **Fillets**:  
  - 15 mm on bottom corners  
  - 10 mm on outer top edges  
- **Support Rib Added**:  
  - A structural rib was added to increase strength and reduce stress concentration during simulation (FEA).

## 🛠️ Software Used

- [Onshape CAD](https://www.onshape.com/)
- Units set to **millimeters (mm)**

## ⚙️ Improvement Goal

The original bracket was improved by:
- Adding **reinforcement rib** to reduce bending stress.
- Keeping all bolt hole sizes and mount locations unchanged.
- Enhancing the **durability** of the bracket under mechanical loads.

## 🧪 FEA Simulation

Each design will be tested using **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** to:
- Compare **stress distribution**
- Measure **displacement and deformation**
- Evaluate **mechanical performance** between original and improved designs
